# Nationality-Predictor
Developed a React app that predicts nationality based on a given name using the Nationalize.io API. Implemented an auto-focused input, a fetch button, and displayed the top country result. Used useState, useEffect, and useRef hooks for state management, effects, and input focus. Built with functional components for efficiency and maintainability.
